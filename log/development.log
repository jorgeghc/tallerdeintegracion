SegÃºn informa hoy El Mercurio, en esta, piden un pronunciamiento por la alianza de dicho partido con la izquierda, lo cual -acusan- ha \"defraudado el proyecto polÃ­tico y social de la Internacional DemÃ³crata Cristiana\". En la misiva, que firma el jefe de bancada, Felipe Ward, se seÃ±ala que \"la incorporaciÃ³n de la Democracia Cristiana nacional a un conglomerado polÃ­tico -en alianza con el Partido Comunista de Chile, la Izquierda Ciudadana, el Movimiento Amplio Social y otras fuerzas polÃ­ticas de extrema izquierda- ha traÃ­do un notable decaimiento de los postulados sustentados por la Internacional DemÃ³crata Cristiana y su importante fundaciÃ³n\". En el texto, asimismo, subrayan que el senador DC AndrÃ©s ZaldÃ­var ha manifestado su adhesiÃ³n por la idea de una integraciÃ³n programÃ¡tica con la izquierda. \"Esto constituye un peligro para los ideales democrÃ¡ticos y el espÃ­ritu de entendimiento que histÃ³ricamente ha tenido la DC\", se indica. AsÃ­, explican que, en 2013, la DC internacional expresÃ³ \"su inquietud\" al ex candidato presidencial de ese partido Claudio Orrego por la alianza con el Partido Comunista. \"La preocupaciÃ³n expuesta por los alemanes es una rÃ©plica de lo que ocurriÃ³ hace algÃºn tiempo en Chile, porque la inquietud de la DCU ya habÃ­a sido expresada al partido de la Falange a travÃ©s de la FundaciÃ³n Konrad Adenauer con sede en Santiago\", dicen. Y finalizan solicitando que, desde Chile, pidan un pronunciamiento de la fundaciÃ³n en Alemania. \"Deseamos que esta preocupaciÃ³n sea extendida e informada al director de su entidad, Hans-Gert PÃ¶ettering, con el objeto de emitir una declaraciÃ³n pÃºblica en torno al camino adoptado por la DC\"."}, "commit"=>"Save Post", "id"=>"2"}
